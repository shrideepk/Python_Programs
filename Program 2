#Write a program for Area of a Rectangle.

# In this program we will take the length and width as input from the user.
length = float(input("Enter the length :"))
width = float (input("Enter the width : "))

# Now calculate the Area by converting the input as floating value.
# Formula for Rectangle is : length*width
area = float(length*width)

# Now print the area by using Print Keyword.
print(f"The area of the Rectangle is :{area}")
